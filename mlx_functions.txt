#COLOR MANAGEMENT

color parameter has an integer type.
The displayed color needs to be encoded in this integer, following a defiend scheme.

All displayable colors can be split in 3 basic colors: red, green, and blue.
Three associated values, in the 0-255 range, represent how much of each color
is mixed up to create the original color.
These three values must be set inside the integer to display the right color.
The three least significant bytes of this integer are filled as shown
in the picture below:

	| 0 | R | G | B |	color integer
	+---+---+---+---+

While filling the integer, make sure you avoid endian problems.
Remember that "blue" byte should always be the least significant one.

void	*mlx_new_image(void *mlx_ptr, int width, int height);

	DISCRIPTION	:

	PARAMETERS	:

	mlx_ptr	: the screen connection identifier.
	width	: the size of the image to be created.
	height	: the size of the image to be created.

	RETURN VALUES	:

	If an error occurs, returns NULL.
	Otherwise, a non-null pointer is returned as an image identifier.



char	*mlx_get_data_addr(void *img_ptr, int *bits_per_pixel, int *size_line, int *endian);

	DISCRIPTION	:

	mlx_get_data_addr() returns information about the created image,
	allowing a user to modify it later.
	It returns a "char *" address that represents the begining of the memory area
	where the image is stored.

	From this address, the first "bits_per_pixel" bits reperesent the color of the
	first pixel in the first line of the image.
	The second group of "bits_per_pixel" bits represent the second pixel of the
	first line, and so on.
	Add "size_line" to the address to get the begining of the second line.
	You can reach any pixels of the image that way.

	PARAMETERS	:
	
	img_ptr		: the image identifier(it specifies the image to use).
		(the three next parameters should be the addresses
		of three different valid integers)
	bits_per_pixel	: the number of bits needed to represent a pixel color.
			  (also called the depth of the image)
	size_line	: the number of bytes used to store one line of the image in memory.
			  This information is needed to move from one line to another
			  in the image.
	endian		: it tells you whether the pixel color in the image needs to be
			  stored in little endian(endian == 0) or big endian(endian == 1).

	RETURN VALUES	:

	It returns "char *" address that represent the bigining of the memory area
	where the image is stored.



int	mlx_put_image_to_window(void *mlx_ptr, void *win_ptr, void *img_ptr, int x, int y);

	DISCRIPTION	:

	The user can draw inside the image, and can dump the image
	insdie a specified window at any time to display it on the screen
	using mlx_put_image_to_window().

	PARAMETERS	:

unsigned int	mlx_get_color_value(void *mlx_ptr, int color);

	DISCRIPTION	:

	mlx_get_color_value() takes a standard RGB color parameter,
	and it returns an unsigned int value.

	(Depending on the display, the number of bits used to store a pixel color can change.
	The user usually represent a color in RGB mode, using one byte for each component.
	This must be translated to fit the "bits_per_pixel" requirement of the image,
	and make the color understandable to the X-Server.
	The "bits_per_pixel" least significant bits of this value can be store in the image.)

	PARAMETERS	:

	mlx_ptr	: the screen connection identifier.
	color	: the standard RGB color.

	RETURN VALUES	: unsigned int value that is translated for X-Server to understand.
